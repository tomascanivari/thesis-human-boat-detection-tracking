# thesis-human-boat-detection-tracking
Repository for my Thesis. Contains configuration files, scripts and evaluation metrics. The datasets and models can be found at:

- [Kaggle Profile](https://www.kaggle.com/tomascccluis):
  - [Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tomascccluis/thesis-human-boat-detection-tracking-datasets)
  - [Trained Models and Inference](https://www.kaggle.com/models/tomascccluis/thesis-human-boat-detection-tracking-models)

The relevant python scripts for evaluation and inference are: `evaluate_detection_folds.py` and `evaluate_tracking_folds.py` for **detection** and **tracking** respectively. After that, go to the `evaluation/` folder and run the respective **metrics** scripts to generate the plots and computed metrics. The other files were used at some point to help the pre-processing, etc... but are not cleaned and up-to date.
